Font Awesome 4
==============

[Font Awesome 4.3.0](http://fontawesome.io) packaged for [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) 1.0+

Packaged by [Tim Pfafman](https://github.com/pfafman/meteor-font-awesome-4)


### Installation

```
meteor add pfafman:font-awesome-4
```

#### Why another package of this?

I am not a fan of the github link on atmosphere not directing me to somewhere I can check out the package.js file to see what the package is adding before installing it.  If you don't care about this then use the [self-proclaimed official packaged version](https://atmospherejs.com/fortawesome/fontawesome).
