Font Awesome 4
==============

[Font Awesome 4.4.0](http://fontawesome.io) packaged for [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) 1.2+

Packaged by [Tim Pfafman](https://github.com/pfafman/meteor-font-awesome-4)


### Installation

```
meteor add pfafman:font-awesome-4
```

#### Why another package of this?

This is not the [official packaged version](https://atmospherejs.com/fortawesome/fontawesome) but I use this one so I can make sure it is up to date and it works in my projects.
